### 👩🏻‍💻 gm! I'm Steph aka [oceans404](https://twitter.com/0ceans404)

I’m a web3 developer working at Polygon Labs, the development and growth team for [Polygon](https://beta.polygon.technology/), as a Developer Relations Engineer. Here are some of my favorite resources and tutorials I've created:
  -  Polygon ID: Gate a Website based on a Verifiable Credential 
     - [Fullstack template for builders](https://github.com/oceans404/fullstack-polygon-id-vc-gated-dapp) - clone this to build a VC gated Dapp with Polygon ID 
  - Polygon zkEVM  
     - [Build a Fullstack Dapp on the Polygon zkEVM Testnet](https://github.com/oceans404/fullstack-zkevm)
     - [Deploy a smart contract to Polygon zkEVM Testnet with Hardhat and verify the contract](https://github.com/oceans404/zkevm-hardhat-demo)

  -  [Create mutable (evolving) NFTs](https://github.com/oceans404/mutable-nfts-tableland-polygon) and update their metadata with SQL queries
  -  [Automate the execution of your smart contracts](https://github.com/oceans404/keepers-contracts) with Chainlink Keepers
  -  [How to decentralize hosting of your front-end React app - Deploy to Fleek](https://github.com/oceans404/fullstack-sockets-demo#deploy-your-frontend)

🏆 I love the energy of hackathons. I've entered and won 7 since [EthOnline 2021](https://youtu.be/xJiABLuD06g?t=1463), and now I mentor web3 devs and help people build cool shit all over the world.

👻 In my past life I was a web2 dev aka a software developer at Amazon, AWS, SONY, and a few startups. I went full time in web3 in 2022 after realizing I was spending my nights and weekends in the crypto space and needed to follow my energy and passion.
