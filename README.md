💜 I’m a web3 developer, currently working at [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) as a Developer Relations Engineer. Here are some of my favorite resources and tutorials I've created:
  -  Polygon ID and Platform APIs
     - [Generate and deploy a Polygon ID Claims Issuer](https://github.com/oceans404/generate-frontend-polygon-id-issuer) 
     - [Programatically create claims with Polygon ID Platform APIs](https://github.com/oceans404/node-polygon-id-platform-apis)
  -  [Create mutable (evolving) NFTs](https://github.com/oceans404/mutable-nfts-tableland-polygon) and update their metadata with SQL queries
  -  [Automate the execution of your smart contracts](https://github.com/oceans404/keepers-contracts) with Chainlink Keepers

🏆 I love the energy of hackathons. I've entered and won 7 since [EthOnline 2021](https://youtu.be/xJiABLuD06g?t=1463), and now I mentor web3 devs and help people build cool shit all over the world.

👻 In my past life I was a web2 dev aka a software developer at Amazon, AWS, SONY, and a few startups. I went full time in web3 in mid 2022 after realizing I was spending my nights and weekends in the crypto space and needed to follow my energy and passion.
