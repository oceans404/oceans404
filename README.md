### 👩🏻‍💻 gm! I'm Steph aka [oceans404](https://twitter.com/0ceans404)

I’m a web3 developer & MPC experimentor, currently leading Developer Relations at [Nillion](https://twitter.com/nillionnetwork) and advising [Polygon Labs](https://twitter.com/0xPolygonLabs).

I 🫶🏼 the energy of hackathons. I've entered and won 7+ since [EthOnline 2021](https://youtu.be/xJiABLuD06g?t=1463), most recently building [Wallet OTP](https://github.com/oceans404/wallet-otp), a decentralized 2FA app that won 6 prizes including being featured as a top HackFS 2023 hackathon finalist. As a DevRel Engineer I mentor web3 builders at hackathons, helping them build useful web3 products all over the world

## bw3 (before web3)

👻 Before web3, I was a software developer at Amazon, AWS, SONY, and a few startups. I went full time in web3 in 2022 after realizing I was spending my nights and weekends in the crypto space and needed to follow my energy and passion.
