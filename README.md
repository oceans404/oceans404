## more web3 work

I ü´∂üèº the energy of hackathons. I've entered and won 7+ since [EthOnline 2021](https://youtu.be/xJiABLuD06g?t=1463), most recently building [Wallet OTP](https://github.com/oceans404/wallet-otp), a decentralized 2FA app that won 6 prizes including being featured as a top HackFS 2023 hackathon finalist. As a DevRel Engineer I mentor web3 builders at hackathons, helping them build useful web3 products all over the world

I worked at Polygon Labs, the development and growth team for [Polygon](https://beta.polygon.technology/), as a Developer Relations Engineer, then an advisor from 2022 - 2023. Here are some of my favorite Polygon resources and tutorials I created:
  -  Polygon ID: Gate a Website based on a Verifiable Credential 
     - [Fullstack template for builders](https://github.com/oceans404/fullstack-polygon-id-vc-gated-dapp) - clone this to build a VC gated Dapp with Polygon ID 
  - Polygon zkEVM  
     - [Build a Fullstack Dapp on the Polygon zkEVM Testnet](https://github.com/oceans404/fullstack-zkevm)
     - [Deploy a smart contract to Polygon zkEVM Testnet with Hardhat and verify the contract](https://github.com/oceans404/zkevm-hardhat-demo)

  -  [Create mutable (evolving) NFTs](https://github.com/oceans404/mutable-nfts-tableland-polygon) and update their metadata with SQL queries
  -  [Automate the execution of your smart contracts](https://github.com/oceans404/keepers-contracts) with Chainlink Keepers
  -  [How to decentralize hosting of your front-end React app - Deploy to Fleek](https://github.com/oceans404/fullstack-sockets-demo#deploy-your-frontend)

## web2 work

üëª Before web3, I was a software developer at Amazon, AWS, SONY, and a few startups - [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephorpilla/). I went full time in web3 during covid after realizing I was spending most of my time exploring and building in the crypto space.
